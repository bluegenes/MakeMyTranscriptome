## Input
The Full tool is a virtual pipeline that staples the other three pipelines (Assembly, Annotation, and Expression) together and enables you to run everything using a single command. When provided with reads, the Full pipeline will generate an assembly from your reads, annotate the assembly it created, then proceed to perform differential expression analysis on the resultant assembly and reads. Because it performs a differential expression analysis, you must provide some metadata describing your reads. This metadata must be specified using the [CSV input format](CSV_input). Because this pipeline uses the same logic as each of the smaller tools, all parameters for each of the tools are available. To execute the Full pipeline, call
```
python pipeline.py full [INPUT] [OPTIONS] [FLAGS]

INPUT - This parameter is required
  --csv CSV             A CSV file specifying fastq input, basenames for DE,
                        and factors for DE. Consult the CSV_input wiki page 
                        for more information

Options
  --subsample_size SUBSAMPLE_SIZE
                        If greater than this number of reads (in millions) is
                        provided, sub sample down to this number. Use 0 to
                        signal that no subsampling should be performed. The
                        deafult value is 50.
  --subsample_seed SUBSAMPLE_SEED
                        A seed used to initialize the random number generator
                        used during random sampling.  
  --busco_ref BUSCO_REF
                        Set the reference that busco will use for analysis

  --model MODEL         An optional list of space separated values used to run
                        differential expression. This is particularly useful
                        for refining Differential Expression runs as it allows
                        you to use the same input CSV file and perform new
                        comparisons. If this option isn't used, a model will be 
                        constructed from the provided csv file
  --cpu CPU             Sets the process cap for execution. Default is 12. Use
                        0 to indicate no process cap should be used.
  --email EMAIL         Pipeline will send emails informing you of runstate.
  --out_dir OUT_DIR     Path to the ouput location. Defaults to assemblies
                        directory inside pipeline
  -o OUT_NAME, --out_name OUT_NAME
                        The name of the output directory to be made in
                        out_dir. If unused, name will be inherited from input
                        file names

FLAGS
  -test                 Use this flag to test the pipeline. The pipeline will 
                        run itself on a set of test data bundled with the tool.
  -no_rmdup             Use thie flag to disable the removing duplicates
                        portion of the pre-assembly read cleaning.
  -no_trim              Use this flag to disable all trimming portions of pre-
                        assembly read cleaning. Duplicate and low quality
                        reads will not be removed. Subsampling will still be
                        executed.
  -rnaspades            Use this flag to specify that assembly should be
                        performed by rnaSPAdes rather than the default
                        Trinity.
  -cegma                Use this flag to run cegma as part of the annotation
                        pipeline. Cegma is an old tool for assesing the
                        quality of assemblies. Normal behavior of the pipeline
                        is to use busco for assesing assemblies. Using this
                        flag will run cegma in addition to Busco.
  -blast_uniref90       Use this flag to enable the uniref-90 blast runs as
                        part of the annotation pipeline.
  -blast_nr             Use this flag to enable the NR (non-redundant protein
                        database) blast runs as part of the annotation
                        pipeline. This could take a very long time to
                        complete.
  -no_log               Pipeline will delete log files.
  -force                Use this flag to perform a fresh run of the pipeline.
                        All steps will be executed regradless of what has
                        already been performed.
```
## Output
The Full pipeline is just the combination of the three smaller pipelines. All files generated by each of the smaller pipelines will be generated by the full pipeline. For details on the files output by the full pipeline, consult the documentation for each of the sub tools. Links are provided below.
